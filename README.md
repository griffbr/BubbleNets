__BubbleNets Framework:__ Deep sorting compares and swaps adjacent frames using their predicted relative performance.

## Setup

Download [resnet_v2_50.ckpt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gn5uvc6foz10lab/resnet_v2_50.ckpt?dl=0) and add to ``./methods/annotate_suggest/ResNet/``.

Add new data to ``./data/rawData/`` folder following the examples provided.
``scooter-black`` is an example with BubbleNets and annotation already complete, and ``soapbox`` is a completely unprocessed folder example.
Each folder in rawData will be used to train a separate segmentation model using the corresponding annotated training data.
Remove folders from rawData if you do not need to train a new model for them.

## Execution Process

__Run__ ``./bubblenets_select_frame.py`` <br />
Uses automatic BubbleNets annotation frame selection with GrabCut-based user annotation tool. BubbleNet selects are stored in a text file (e.g., ``./rawData/scooter-black/frame_selection/BN0.txt``), so using another annotation tool is also possible. <br />
[native Python, has scikit dependency, requires TensorFlow]

__Run__ ``./osvos_segment_video.py`` <br />
Runs OSVOS segmentation given user-provided annotated training frames. Trained OSVOS models are stored in ``./data/models/``. Results are timestamped and will appear in the ``./results/`` folder. <br />
[native Python, requires TensorFlow]

## Generating Training Labels (New)

Code for generating new BubbleNets training labels is located in the ``./generate_labels`` folder.
